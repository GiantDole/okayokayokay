-- Seed file for local development
-- This file contains sample data for testing

-- Note: In local development, auth.users will be populated via Supabase Auth
-- This seed assumes you'll create test users through the auth system

-- Sample data will be inserted here after users are created through auth
-- For now, this is a placeholder to demonstrate the structure

-- Example of how to insert sample transactions (uncomment and modify after creating test users):
-- INSERT INTO transactions (request_id, buyer_id, seller_id, amount, status, resource_url)
-- VALUES
--   (decode('0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001', 'hex'),
--    '<buyer-uuid>',
--    '0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678',
--    100.00,
